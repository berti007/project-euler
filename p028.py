# Number spiral diagonals
   
# Problem 28
# Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

# 21 22 23 24 25
# 20  7  8  9 10
# 19  6  1  2 11
# 18  5  4  3 12
# 17 16 15 14 13

# It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

# What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?


def compute():
	SIZE = 1001  # Must be odd
	ans = 1  # Special case for size 1
	ans += sum(4 * i * i - 6 * (i - 1) for i in range(3, SIZE + 1, 2))
	return str(ans)
